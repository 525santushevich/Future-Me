            <p class="card_text">Real estate developers play an important role in the industry as they bridge the gap between the construction ability and the investor’s need. They cater to the value of a project in terms of design, functionality, cost and location. They also work hard in order to absorb international trends, deliver quality realty products and analyse customers’ expectations. The developers form an important aspect of the realty sector as they fulfill the critical need for infrastructure in areas like housing, office space, retail and entertainment, etc.

Some developers report to the job site every day, don a hard hat, and oversee the work of roofers, plumbers, and electricians. The developer must be flexible enough to adjust to the job's varying demands.</p>

          <h2 class="card_title">Family</h2>
          <h5 class="card-title">Vincent Van Gogh was born into a family of a low social class. He had always enjoyed art even though his parents didn't agree with his perspective. However, his parents as well as his siblings supported Vincent on his path to success. Additionally, Vincent's brother, Theo, had art of his own but not up to the standards of Vincent.</h5>

          <h5 class="card-title">Over the course of many years, Vincent Van Gogh became very close with his friend, Paul Gauguin. Earlier, Van Gogh had moved to Arles from Paris in order to establish what he called a “studio of the south”. There, he studied his skills and Gauguin accepted Van Gogh’s enthusiastic invitation, swayed heavily by the promised financial support from his art dealer.</h5>

          <h2 class="card_title">Artwork</h2>
          <h5 class="card-title">Vincent van Gogh is mostly remembered for his striking color, definitive brushwork, and contoured forms of his art. While his paintings were beautiful works of art, they weren't appreciated while he was alive, primarily because he was smarter and ahead of his time, unsociable, mentally troubled, and uninterested in marketing himself.</h5>

          <h5 class="card-title">Vincent van Gogh struggled with mental illness throughout his life, but put his struggles into his art to eventually become one of the greatest artists in history. Depression and confusion caused Vincent Van Gogh to cut off his ear, shocking most of his companions. Sadly, on July 29 of 1890, Vincent Van Gogh committed suicide by shooting himself in the chest.</h5>
